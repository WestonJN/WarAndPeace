How did i figure out this problem?

The first thing that I thought of when trying to figure out how to create
a program that will enable me to find the most frequenlty appearing 
word in the book War and Peace was, what format will allow me to easily
read through it contents? I then downloaded the book in a txt format.

The txt format enables me to read through it without having to do any
conversions. This then reminded me that node has allows me to read through
txt files using readFile. Then all i needed to do was use Regex to cater for
the spaces in between words, create a forEach function that will loop through 
each word and save it and its occurance in a new array, then sort it in decending
order and print out the first index in the array.


Steps that i used to ensure accuracy.

The only thing i could think of was using a smaller text file with less information.
I ran this text in the program and it displayed the most frequent word. Which i then 
could count to verify, i then deleted all instance of that word in the text and ran the 
program again, the word that was second was now first. This is how i checked for accuracy.
